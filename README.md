Overview
This project is a Generative AI-based contract generator that creates legally structured contracts dynamically based on user inputs. Unlike traditional template-based approaches, the system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customized contracts tailored to specific needs, such as:

Employment agreements

Business contracts

Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)

Rental agreements

And more...

Users can enter key details such as party names, contract terms, responsibilities, compensation, and conditions. The AI then generates a legally formatted contract containing essential clauses like confidentiality, dispute resolution, and termination policies.

The system runs on GPU-accelerated environments (e.g., Google Colab or other GPU backends) to ensure efficient text generation and handles the computationally intensive tasks involved in large-scale language modeling.

Key Features
Dynamic Contract Generation: No reliance on rigid templates; each contract is generated uniquely based on user input.

Clause Customization: Users can specify particular clauses (e.g., confidentiality, termination, dispute resolution).

Scalable & Efficient: Runs on GPU-accelerated setups to handle large model computations.

Extensible: Designed to easily add new contract types or domain-specific clauses.

Tech Stack
Frontend
Next.js: React framework for building the ChatGPT-like interface.

Prisma ORM: Database toolkit for seamless interaction with the PostgreSQL database.

PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing user inputs, contract data, or usage logs.

tRPC Routing: Type-safe APIs and client-server communication.

TypeScript: Strongly typed language for improved developer experience and reliability.

Generative AI
Hugging Face Transformers / Large Language Models (LLMs): The core text-generation functionality.

GPU Accelerators: (e.g., Google Colab, AWS, etc.) for model inference.

LangChain: (Optional) For chaining multiple LLM calls, vector databases, and advanced prompt engineering.

Challenges Faced
Limitation of Available GPU Processing Power
Running large models can be computationally expensive and time-consuming without robust GPU resources.

Lack of Legal Accuracy
LLMs may generate legally plausible but not always accurate or jurisdiction-specific clauses.

No Labeled Dataset
Without a specialized, labeled legal dataset, the system relies on pre-trained models and prompt engineering to guide contract generation.

Future Improvements
Multilingual Support
Enable contract generation in multiple languages for international or regional legal needs.

Automated Legal Compliance Checks
Integrate with legal databases or compliance checkers to ensure the generated contracts adhere to specific local regulations.

How It Works
User Inputs: The user provides contract details (e.g., party names, scope of work, compensation, timelines).

LLM Processing: The model processes the input using prompt templates designed for legal language.

Contract Generation: The system outputs a fully drafted contract, including standard clauses and user-specific details.

User Review & Edit: The generated contract can be reviewed, edited, or further customized before finalization.
